# Coding Agent Guide: GPU-Accelerated Rive Renderer with NDI Output

## Mission Overview
You are extending YUP to deliver a Windows-focused pipeline that renders Rive (`.riv`) animations offscreen via Direct3D 11 and exposes frames (with alpha) to Python for NDI transmission. The end result is a reusable C++ core (built with CMake/Visual Studio), a pybind11-powered Python module, and a lightweight Python control layer that can drive NDI streams and optional REST/OSC endpoints. Audio/plugin subsystems in YUP remain untouched and disabled at runtime.

**Supported platform:** Windows 11 with MSVC 2022 and the Windows 10/11 SDK. Other platforms may compile stub implementations, but only Windows requires full functionality.

## Implementation Snapshot (April 2025)
| Area | Status | Key Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct3D 11 offscreen renderer | âœ… `yup::RiveOffscreenRenderer` initialises the D3D11 device/context, renders into a BGRA texture, and performs CPU readback via a configurable staging-buffer ring. | `modules/yup_gui/artboard/yup_RiveOffscreenRenderer.h/.cpp` |
| Scene & animation control | âœ… Artboard enumeration, animation/state-machine playback, pause toggling, and state-machine input helpers are exposed through the renderer API. | `modules/yup_gui/artboard/yup_RiveOffscreenRenderer.cpp` |
| Renderer tests | âœ… GoogleTest coverage validates frame stride/dimensions, pause semantics, shared-buffer behaviour, and artboard switching. | `tests/yup_gui/yup_RiveOffscreenRenderer.cpp` |
| Python renderer binding | âœ… `yup_rive_renderer` pybind11 module wraps renderer construction (including staging-buffer depth), artboard/animation APIs, and exposes zero-copy frame views. | `python/src/yup_rive_renderer.cpp`, build glue in `python/CMakeLists.txt`, packaging metadata in `python/pyproject.toml` |
| Python NDI orchestration | âœ… `yup_ndi` package manages multi-stream orchestration, timestamp mapping, metadata dispatch, and optional control hooks using mocked `cyndilib` senders for tests while forwarding renderer options such as staging-buffer depth. | `python/yup_ndi/__init__.py`, `python/yup_ndi/orchestrator.py`, tests under `python/tests/test_yup_ndi/` |
| Python test harness | âœ… `pytest` suites cover binding behaviour, orchestrator frame flow, and provide fake renderer/sender utilities that avoid native DLL requirements. | `python/tests/` |
| Browser-based control panel | âœ… Static control panel previews `.riv` files in-browser, surfaces artboard/animation metadata, streams live JSON payloads for orchestrator smoke tests, and links back to packaged demo builds for reviewers. | `standalone/rive_frontend/`, minified demo builds in `docs/demos/` |
| Documentation & developer workflow | ðŸš§ Docs now include Windows onboarding (`docs/Windows Build and Packaging.md`) and a `tools/install_windows.ps1` bootstrap script, but the orchestration walkthrough and troubleshooting appendix still need richer end-to-end examples. |

## Documentation Cross-References
- **Mandatory:** ALWAYS update the relevant documentation whenever you change code. Every feature, bug
  fix, or behaviour tweak must be reflected in the docs before the worktree is considered complete.
- **Primary documentation entry points:**
  - `README.md` â€“ quickstart build/test recipes and API overview.
  - `docs/rive_ndi_overview.md` â€“ Windows-focused walkthrough of the renderer â†’ NDI flow.
  - `docs/Rive to NDI Guide.md` â€“ detailed step-by-step orchestration and tooling guide.
  - `docs/Windows Build and Packaging.md` â€“ MSVC toolchain, packaging, and release notes.
  - `docs/BUILD_WINDOWS.md` â€“ legacy but still-referenced Windows build primer.
  - `docs/Building Plugins.md` and `docs/Building Standalone.md` â€“ ancillary build targets.
  - `docs/YUP Module Format.md` â€“ module metadata expectations.
  - `standalone/rive_frontend/` â€“ temporary browser control panel; keep copy updates mirrored in the minified builds under `docs/demos/` and ensure the generated payload schema matches `python/yup_ndi/orchestrator.py`.
- **Quick orientation:** Start with the redundancy-pruning checklist in `README.md` to understand the trim plan for legacy modules and the guardrails that must remain while focusing on the Rive â†’ NDI path.
- **Rive â†’ NDI flow:** The canonical walkthrough lives in `docs/Rive to NDI Guide.md`. It maps renderer classes to Python bindings, calls out the minimal module surface needed for transmission, and links TODOs for each subsystem.
- **Legacy dependency audit:** Inline breadcrumbs inside `modules/yup_gui/artboard/yup_RiveOffscreenRenderer.*` and `python/yup_ndi/orchestrator.py` enumerate bindings/tests that must stay aligned if refactors delete surrounding helpers.
- **Testing expectations:** Use the guidance embedded in `python/tests/conftest.py` and `python/tests/common.py` to respect the mock strategy for environments without the native extension. Honour the skip markers before trimming any "legacy" fixtures that keep pytest green.
- **Build/packaging recipes:** Use the pointers in `tools/` and the notes in `python/pyproject.toml` to keep MSVC/Ninja build flags, version pinning, and wheel metadata consistent with the Windows toolchain assumptions documented above.
  - `tools/install_windows.ps1` now automates the end-to-end Windows build, wheel packaging, and smoke testsâ€”keep it in sync with manual instructions and update its dependency pins whenever the Python layer adds requirements.

## Codebase Map
Use this quick-reference map to locate the canonical implementations before introducing new functionality. Reviewing these areas first helps avoid duplicating existing work.

### Core C++ Renderer & Engine
- `modules/yup_gui/artboard/`: Rive offscreen renderer implementation (`yup_RiveOffscreenRenderer.*`), scene management helpers, texture readback, and animation control utilities.
- `modules/yup_gui/native/`: Platform-specific glue for Windows. Non-Windows builds contain stub placeholdersâ€”extend only when broadening platform support.
- `modules/yup_core/` and `modules/yup_graphics/`: Shared engine primitives (logging, result types, graphics context helpers) that the renderer depends on. Prefer extending these modules over creating parallel abstractions.

### Python Bindings & Orchestration
- `python/src/`: pybind11 bindings that expose renderer capabilities to Python. `yup_rive_renderer.cpp` is the authoritative binding surface.
- `python/yup_ndi/`: High-level orchestration for NDI output, metadata handling, and stream control logic.
- `python/tests/`: `pytest` suites covering bindings, orchestration, and mock senders. Update or extend tests alongside feature changes.

### Tooling, Examples, and Docs
- `tools/`: Build, packaging, and CI helpers (`package_wheel.py`, environment setup scripts).
- `docs/`: Conceptual guides, including the Rive â†’ NDI walkthrough. The `docs/demos/` subtree hosts minified control-panel builds for documentation hostingâ€”refresh these alongside any frontend copy or schema changes.
- `examples/`: Minimal end-to-end usage samples. Use these as starting points when demonstrating new capabilities.

### Ancillary Assets
- `standalone/`: Sandbox applications and experiments. `standalone/rive_frontend/` contains the temporary browser control panelâ€”keep it aligned with orchestrator semantics when updating UI copy, emitted JSON, or hotkey bindings.
- `thirdparty/`: External dependencies (e.g., Rive SDK, pybind11). Confirm licence compatibility before introducing new vendored code.
- `cmake/` and `CMakeLists.txt`: Build system entry points. Integrate new modules by extending the existing CMake structure rather than creating ad-hoc scripts.

## Coding Standards & Structure
The following conventions apply to all new or modified source files within this repository:

### Required File Header
Start every new source file with the exact ISC licence banner below. Update legacy files if they are missing it when you touch them.

```cpp
/*

```

### Module Header Block
Primary module headers (e.g., `yup_graphics.h`) must also include the declaration block below immediately after the licence banner. Update `module_name` and other fields appropriately.

```cpp
/*
  ==============================================================================

  BEGIN_YUP_MODULE_DECLARATION

    ID:                 module_name
    vendor:             yup

  END_YUP_MODULE_DECLARATION

  ==============================================================================
*/
```

### Formatting, Naming, and Includes
- Follow Allman-style braces for all scopes.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for functions, variables, constants, and member fields.
- Match file names to the primary class (e.g., `yup_ClassName.h/.cpp`).
- Keep include order as follows: own header (if in a `.cpp`), C++ standard library, external dependencies (Rive, etc.), other YUP modules, and finally headers from the same module.
- Avoid `using namespace` in headers; limit its use to the narrowest possible scope within implementation or test files.

### File & Test Organisation
- Modules should remain shallow: a top-level header/implementation pair with a single nested directory for related classes and a `native/` folder for per-platform sources.
- Unit tests live under `tests/<module_name>/` and should be grouped by class or integration scenario.

## Design & Implementation Principles
- Prefer RAII and smart pointers for resource management.
- Use `std::optional` for optional values and `yup::String` for most string operations (use `std::string` only when bridging external APIs).
- Keep classes narrowly focused, apply const-correctness, and favour composition over inheritance.
- Guard platform-specific code with the appropriate `#if YUP_<PLATFORM>` macros and provide functional Windows implementations plus stubs elsewhere.
- Surface errors through `yup::Result`/`yup::ResultValue<T>` patterns and mirror renderer errors via `RiveOffscreenRenderer::getLastError()` in Python exceptions.
- Document all public APIs with Doxygen comments and maintain American English spelling (`color`, `center`, etc.).

## Testing Expectations
- Extend GoogleTest coverage for C++ changes and `pytest` suites for Python updates. Provide mocks when native dependencies (NDI, GPU) are unavailable in CI.
- Coordinate integration testing across the renderer and Python orchestration layers; smoke-test the pybind11 bindings feeding the orchestrator when possible.
- When touching test infrastructure, respect the skip markers and helper utilities in `python/tests/` to keep environments without the native extension passing.

## Current Priorities
1. **Control-panel alignment:** Keep the `standalone/rive_frontend/` UI, generated summary payloads, REST/OSC hooks, and orchestrator entry points in lockstep. Mirror UX wording changes in the minified `docs/demos/` builds and documentation.
2. **Orchestration playbook:** Expand `docs/Rive to NDI Guide.md` with an end-to-end walkthrough that mirrors the latest Windows bootstrap script, including troubleshooting for NDI discovery and GPU readback stalls.
3. **Integration testing:** Add or extend combined tests that exercise the renderer bindings feeding the NDI orchestrator (mocked senders acceptable in CI).
4. **Performance validation:** Profile renderer â†’ Python throughput to ensure zero-copy semantics on Windows hardware and document the benchmarks.

## TODO List
- [ ] Publish an updated control-panel payload schema example in `docs/rive_ndi_overview.md` and sync the same JSON snippet into `docs/demos/` release notes.
- [ ] Refresh `tools/install_windows.ps1` to cover the new optional browser build step and validate the generated artifacts with `just smoke:ndi` on a clean Windows host.
- [ ] Record a short troubleshooting appendix for common Windows GPU driver issues discovered during the latest offscreen renderer QA pass.

# Packaging
- Run `python tools/package_wheel.py` to produce a release-mode build and wheel.

## Workflow Expectations
- Analyse existing helpers (e.g., `modules/yup_graphics/`, `modules/yup_core/`) before introducing new abstractions; reuse utilities wherever feasible.
- Keep build flags, documentation, and scripts aligned with Windows 11 + MSVC 2022 assumptions. Non-Windows builds may remain stubbed but must compile.
- Maintain focused change setsâ€”avoid formatting-only commits and unrelated subsystem modifications.

Stay focused on delivering a polished Windows pipeline from Rive rendering through Python-based NDI streaming while maintaining clear documentation for future contributors.
