# Rive → NDI Pipeline Guide (Preview)

This guide is being prepared to document the workflow for streaming Rive animations to NDI using the YUP toolchain.

> [!NOTE]
> When configuring with `-DYUP_ENABLE_AUDIO_MODULES=OFF`, YUP automatically skips the audio-dependent console, app, graphics, and plugin samples as well as the CTest suite. This keeps the slimmed-down Rive→NDI workflow free from audio build requirements.

Additional sections covering renderer setup, Python bindings, and NDI orchestration will be added soon.
