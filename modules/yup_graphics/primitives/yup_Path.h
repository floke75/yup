/** Represents a 2D geometric path.

    The Path class encapsulates a series of geometric operations and shapes that can be described
    using lines, curves, and basic geometric shapes. It provides methods to construct and manipulate
    these paths with operations such as moving to a point, drawing lines, curves, rectangles,
    rounded rectangles, ellipses, and arcs. It supports both simple constructs such as lines and
    complex cubic Bezier curves.

    This class uses an internal storage mechanism to keep track of each segment in the path,
    allowing for efficient modifications and rendering. The Path can be used for drawing operations,
    hit testing, and bounding box calculations.
