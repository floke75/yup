/** Define a type alias for a function that casts a YUP Component to a pointer of a specified type.

    This type alias defines a function pointer named `ComponentTypeCaster`. This function is designed to take a YUP Component
    and a reference to a `std::type_info` object, and it returns a constant pointer to void. The purpose of this function is to enable
    dynamic casting of a YUP Component to a specific derived class type. It can be used for tasks like type-safe downcasting of
    components in a straw application when obtaining Components in scripts and it's used by pybind11.

    @warning Be cautious when using this function as it deals with low-level type information and dynamic casting.

    @param component A pointer to a YUP Component that you want to cast to a specific type.
    @param typeInfo  A reference to a `std::type_info` object representing the target type.

    @return A constant pointer to void that can be interpreted as a pointer to an instance of the target type
            if the cast is successful. If the cast fails, it may return a null pointer.
