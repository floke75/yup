/**
    Abstract base class for writing audio sample data to formatted audio streams.

    AudioFormatWriter provides a standardized interface for encoding and writing audio data
    to various audio file formats. Each concrete implementation handles the specific encoding
    requirements of a particular format (such as WAV, FLAC, or MP3), while accepting
    floating-point sample data through a unified API.

    Key features:
    - Accepts floating-point samples for consistent input format
    - Handles format-specific encoding and bit depth conversion internally
    - Supports multi-channel audio output with proper interleaving
    - Provides metadata embedding capabilities where supported by the format
    - Offers both direct sample writing and high-level convenience methods
    - Includes threaded writing support for background processing

    The writer is configured during construction with essential parameters like sample rate,
    channel count, and bit depth. These parameters determine how the floating-point input
    samples are encoded into the target format's specific representation.

    Format-specific implementations are typically created through AudioFormat::createWriterFor(),
    which validates parameters against format capabilities and instantiates the appropriate
    writer with proper configuration.
