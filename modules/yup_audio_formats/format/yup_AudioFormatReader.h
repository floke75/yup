/**
    Abstract base class for reading audio sample data from formatted audio streams.

    AudioFormatReader provides a standardized interface for reading audio data from various
    audio file formats. Each concrete implementation handles the specific decoding requirements
    of a particular format (such as WAV, FLAC, or MP3), while presenting a unified API for
    accessing audio samples as floating-point data.

    Key features:
    - Converts all audio data to floating-point samples for consistent processing
    - Supports multi-channel audio with flexible channel mapping
    - Provides metadata extraction capabilities
    - Offers both low-level sample reading and high-level convenience methods
    - Includes level analysis and sample searching functionality

    The reader maintains important audio properties such as sample rate, bit depth, channel count,
    and total length in samples. It also preserves metadata found in the audio file for applications
    that need access to title, artist, album information, and other embedded data.

    Format-specific implementations are typically created through AudioFormat::createReaderFor(),
    which handles the complexities of format detection and appropriate reader instantiation.
