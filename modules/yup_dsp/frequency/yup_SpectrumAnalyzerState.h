/**
    Real-time safe spectrum analyzer data collection class.

    This class handles the collection of audio samples from the audio thread and provides a lock-free interface
    for UI components to retrieve FFT-ready data. It uses AbstractFifo for thread-safe communication between
    the audio and UI threads.

    The audio thread should call pushSample() or pushSamples() to feed audio data. The UI thread should check
    isFFTDataReady() and call getFFTData() to retrieve samples for FFT processing.

    This class follows the same pattern as MidiKeyboardState - it handles the real-time safe data collection while
    leaving the processing and visualization to companion classes.
